# Knowledgeware Product Portfolio

**Enterprise Knowledge Intelligence Platform + Applications**

> *Building the plane while flying it - A living demonstration of AI-enhanced knowledge management, DevSecOps automation, and recursive improvement.*

## Overview

Knowledgeware is an integrated product portfolio that combines **platform infrastructure** with **domain-specific applications** to create an enterprise-grade knowledge intelligence ecosystem. The portfolio embodies the principle of **dogfooding** - using our own products to build, manage, and evolve themselves.

## Dogfooding Methodology

This portfolio is a living demonstration of its own principles:

1. **Knowledge Management:** All portfolio artifacts are managed using KIP
2. **Infrastructure Automation:** All deployments use Nautilus
3. **Integration:** GENESIS connects the products
4. **Continuous Improvement:** Insights from usage feed back into product evolution

## Getting Started

*(To be populated as products mature)*

## Contributing

This is a portfolio of products developed through human-AI collaboration, demonstrating advanced product management and knowledge intelligence principles.

## License
